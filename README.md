# liri-node-app

A Language Recognition Doo-Dad for your Siri-like questions.


Search movies with movie-this <movie title> (or no title! Defaults to "Mr. Nobody)
Search concerts with concert-this <artist> (Beware! This one is pretty big)
Search songs with spotify-this-song <song title> (or no title at all! Defaults to "The Sign", by Ace of Base)
Pick a random search from a random.txt file with do-what-it-says (nothing extra is needed)
Do a quick sanity check of the program to make sure Liri is listening with moo (again, nothing extra is needed)
  
Everything logs back to the console and to log.txt

Please note:

You will need your own .env file with:

#Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=<Your personal ID>
SPOTIFY_SECRET=<Your personal Spotify secret>
  
Also, make sure to npm init and install all dependencies

Have fun!
